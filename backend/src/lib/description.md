# `lib` Folder Description

The `lib` folder contains reusable utility functions, helpers, and modules that support the backend logic of the application. These files are designed to be generic and can be imported across different parts of the project to promote code reuse and maintainability.

Typical contents include:
- Utility functions (e.g., data formatting, validation)
- Custom middleware
- Third-party integrations
- Shared logic not tied to a specific feature

Organizing code in the `lib` folder helps keep the codebase clean and modular.
