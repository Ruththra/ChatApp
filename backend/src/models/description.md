# Why the `models` Folder is Needed in React Projects

The `models` folder is essential in React projects, especially when building applications with a backend (such as Node.js). It serves the following purposes:

- **Data Structure Definition:** Models define the structure of data objects, ensuring consistency throughout the application.
- **Database Interaction:** They provide a blueprint for how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated in the database.
- **Validation:** Models help validate data before it is saved, reducing errors and improving data integrity.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keeping models in a dedicated folder organizes the codebase, making it easier to maintain and scale.

In summary, the `models` folder helps manage and structure data efficiently in full-stack React applications.
