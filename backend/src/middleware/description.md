# Why a Middleware Folder is Needed in React Projects

The `middleware` folder is essential in React projects, especially when building full-stack applications with a backend. Middleware functions act as intermediaries between incoming requests and the application's core logic. They help with tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and request validation.

## Key Reasons for a Middleware Folder

- **Separation of Concerns:** Organizes reusable logic away from route handlers, keeping code clean and maintainable.
- **Reusability:** Middleware functions can be applied to multiple routes, reducing code duplication.
- **Scalability:** Makes it easier to add or modify features like security checks or data processing as the project grows.
- **Consistency:** Ensures consistent handling of requests and responses across the application.

In summary, the `middleware` folder improves code structure, maintainability, and scalability in React backend projects.
